        <p class="text">This is an authentic Indian naan recipe that's broiled instead of pan-fried.</p>
        <h2 class="heading text">NAAN, often pronounced as nah-ahn is an Indian flatbread legend known for its soft, pillowy texture and rich buttery flavor</h2>
        <p class="text">Naan is a leavened, oven-baked (usually using a tandoor) or tawa-fried flatbread.</p>
        <p class="text">Naan is a single-layer bread with a light and slightly fluffy texture and golden-brown spots from the baking process. It is made primarily from white flour or wheat flour and a leavening agent (usually yeast), which results in the formation of air pockets in the dough that impart fluffiness and softness.</p>

        <ul>Ingredients</div>
        <div class="text list">
            <li>2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ghee</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kalonji (onion seed)</li>

        <ol class="subtext">Steps
            <div class="text list">
            <li>Whisk warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, yogurt, and 1/2 of the ghee. Mix into a soft dough, then knead on a floured surface until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough into a large greased bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough, then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into six equal pieces. Roll each piece out into 8-inch rounds.</li>
            <li>Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush dough rounds with remaining ghee and sprinkle with kalonji. Cook one at a time under the broiler until puffed and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
