        <p>These roasted chickpeas are seasoned with Indian spices to make crisp, spicy little nibbles.</p>
        <h2>These spicy roasted chickpeas are great as a snack, appetizer, made into wraps or paired with your favorite Indian meal.</h2>
        <p>A member of the legume family, chickpeas have a delicious nutty taste, creamy texture and are extremely nutritious. Slightly bigger in size than a pea, chickpeas may be tiny but are certainly well-deserving of their superfood status, being packed full of nutrients and health benefits.</p>

        <ul><b>Ingredients</b>
            <li>2 cups canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <ol><b>Steps</b>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Stir together chickpeas, lemon juice, olive oil, brown sugar, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, garam masala, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt in a mixing bowl. Spread chickpea mixture in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until chickpeas are dark brown in spots, crisp, and have shrunk quite a bit, 25 to 30 minutes, stirring halfway through the cooking time. Cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
